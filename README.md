# Nixon is a free and open-source 1.8.9 client using the Forge API for Minecraft.

I am learning client development with this project, it is in no way meant to be actually useful.

## Setting up a Workspace

Nixon uses Maven, to make sure that it is installed properly you can check the Apache [website](https://maven.apache.org/). It also requires the Java 1.8 JDK to be installed. I recommend using [Amazon Coretto](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html)

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Thebozzz34/Nixon`
2. Open the folder as a Maven project in your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the client

## Additional info

Nixon is powered by the [MavenMCP](https://github.com/Marcelektro/MavenMCP-1.8.9/), [Forge](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/), and [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home)
